    <p>
      Weather Mood Challenge Ask the user two things: The temperature (number)
      Whether itâ€™s raining (yes or no) Then use if, else if, and else to give a
      weather-based message. For example: If itâ€™s over 30Â°C â†’ "It's hot
      outside!" If itâ€™s under 15Â°C â†’ "Brrr! It's chilly." Otherwise â†’ "The
      weather's nice today." BUT! If itâ€™s also raining, change the message to
      something like: "Hot *and* rainy? Yikes!" "Cold and rainy â€” time for tea!"
      "Mild, but raining â€” donâ€™t forget your umbrella." ðŸ’¡ Hint: Youâ€™ll probably
      need to use nesting or combine conditions with && (AND).
